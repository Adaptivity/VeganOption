The Vegan Option
================

Minecraft mod that seeks to add vegan alternatives to all Minecraft animal products using the following guidelines:

- Nothing added to worldgen
- No new crops added

### Currently Implemented Alternatives

#### Jute Fibre/Burlap (leather/string)

- Jute Stalks drop from harvesting Large Ferns
- 3x3 of Jute Stalks crafted together makes a Jute Bundle
- Jute Bundle, when placed next to or under water, will start retting
- Once retted, the Jute Bundle can be broken to get a variable amount of Jute Fibre
- Jute Fibre can be crafted into Burlap (2x2) or String (1x2)
- Burlap is a 1:1 alternative to Leather

#### Kapok (wool/string/feather)

- Kapok Tufts are a semi-rare drop from Jungle Leaves
- Kapok Tufts can be crafted into Block of Kapok (2x2) or String (1x3)
- Block of Kapok is a 1:1 alternative to Wool
- Kapok Tufts can be crafted with a Stick to make a Faux Feather
- Faux Feather is a 1:1 alternative to Feather

#### Straw Bed (bed)

- Crafted using Hay Bales instead of Wool
